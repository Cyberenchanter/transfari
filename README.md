# Transfari

Transfari is a lightweight translation extension designed for Safari.
I just arrived in Sweden and Safari's built-in translation can't translate Swedish websites.
And I hate Chrome for privacy reasons. When I looked up in the App Store most translation extension are paid options. So I wrote this with the help of ChatGPT. Enjoy FOSS lads.


## Translation Engines Supported:
Google Translate 

Google Cloud Translation API (bring your own key)

DeepL Free Translation API (bring your own key)


## How to use:
### iOS
Install via AltStore (for now, I'm still considering whether to pay $100 to Apple or not).
### macOS
Download via GitHub Release, then allow it in your Security & Privacy settings.

Enable the extension in Safari.

Select your translation engine and your target language then click 'save settings'.

Click translate page.
