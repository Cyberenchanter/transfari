# Transfari

Transfari is a lightweight, free and open source translation extension designed for Safari.
I just arrived in Sweden and Safari's built-in translation can't translate Swedish websites.
And I don't wanna use Chrome for privacy reasons. When I looked up in the App Store most translation extension are paid options. So I wrote this with the help of ChatGPT. Enjoy it.
