# Transfari

Transfari is a lightweight, free and open source translation extension designed for Safari.
I just arrived in Sweden and Safari's built-in translation can't translate Swedish websites.
And I don't wanna use Chrome for privacy reasons. When I looked up in the App Store most translation extension are paid options. So I wrote this with the help of ChatGPT. Enjoy it.


## Translation Engines Supported:
Google Translate 

Google Cloud Translation API (bring your own key)

DeepL Free Translation API (bring your own key)


## How to use:
### iOS
I'm trying to submit it to the App Store(with a developer subscription paid out of my own pocket, could take some time).
### macOS
Download via GitHub Release, then allow it in your Security & Privacy settings.

Enable 'Show features for web developers' in the Advanced tab of Safari settings, then enable 'Allow unsigned extensions' in the Developer tab.

Enable the extension in Safari.

Select your translation engine and your target language then click 'translate page'.
