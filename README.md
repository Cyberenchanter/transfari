# Transfari

Transfari is a lightweight translation extension designed for Safari.
I just arrived in Sweden and Safari's built-in translation can't translate Swedish websites.
And I hate Chrome for privacy reasons. When I looked up in the App Store most translation extension are paid options. So I wrote this with the help of ChatGPT. Enjoy FOSS lads.

Google Cloud Translation API (bring your own key)
